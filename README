Usage:

    btty [N]

Provide access to virtual terminal associated with /dev/ttyN on the current
console. Default N is 1. This can used to start Xwindows via ssh, for example.

All key codes are passed verbatim (except 'ctrl-]'), but note your console's
idea of what an extended key sequence is may not agree with the terminal's (and
changing the terminal's TERM probably won't help).

Ctrl-L is passed to the terminal, but also triggers a redraw of the console.

Ctrl-] exits the program.

Program will display the contents of the terminal but the abort on first
keypress if not running as root.

Program will abort with error if the virtual console is larger than the current
console. In this case you can change the virtual console size with:

    stty rows $LINES cols $COLUMNS < /dev/ttyX
