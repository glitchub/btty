Usage:

    btty [N]

Provide access to virtual terminal associated with /dev/ttyN on the current
console. Default N is 1. This can used to start Xwindows via ssh, for example.

All key codes are passed verbatim (except 'ctrl-]'), but note your console's
idea idea of what an extended key sqquence is may not agree with the terminal's
(and changing the terminal's TERM probably won't help).

Ctrl-L is passed to the terminal, but also triggers a redraw of the console.

Ctrl-] exits the program.

Program will display the contents of the terminal but the abort on first
keypress if not running as root.
